# Color Flipper ðŸŽ¨
A simple web application that lets you generate random hex color codes and apply them to the background of a webpage.

### How it Works
The color flipper is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code generates a random hex color code and updates both the displayed color code and the background color of the webpage when the button is clicked.

### How to Use
1. Open the ```index.html``` file in a web browser.
2. Click the button to generate a random hex color code.
3. The color code will be displayed, and the background color of the webpage will change accordingly.

Feel free to use and modify this color flipper for your projects! ðŸš€
